                        Istanbul is a major city in Turkey that straddles Europe and Asia
                        across the Bosphorus Strait. Its Old City reflects cultural
                        influences of the many empires that once ruled here. In the
                        Sultanahmet district, the open-air, Roman-era Hippodrome was for
                        centuries the site of chariot races, and Egyptian obelisks also
                        remain. The iconic Byzantine Hagia Sophia features a soaring
                        6th-century dome and rare Christian mosaics.
